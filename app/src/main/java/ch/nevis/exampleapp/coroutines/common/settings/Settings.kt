     * By default the SDK will only allow to use Class 3 (formerly strong) sensors. Using Class 2 sensors is
     * less secure and discouraged. When a Class 2 sensor is used, the FIDO UAF keys are not protected by the
     * operating system by requiring user authentication.
     * If the SDK detects that only Class 3 (strong) biometric sensors are available in the mobile device,
     * even if Class 2 sensors are allowed, the FIDO UAF credentials will be protected by the operating system
     * by requiring user authentication.
     * However in some cases it may be acceptable for the sake of end-user convenience. Allowing Class 2
     * sensors will enable for instance the use of face recognition in some Samsung devices.
