        Specifies whether <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/biometric/measure#biometric-classes">
        Class 2 (formerly weak)</a> biometric sensors are allowed if the biometric authenticator is selected.
        By default the SDK will only allow to use Class 3 (formerly strong) sensors. Using Class 2 sensors is
        less secure and discouraged. When a Class 2 sensor is used, the FIDO UAF keys are not protected by the
        operating system by requiring user authentication.
        If the SDK detects that only Class 3 (strong) biometric sensors are available in the mobile device,
        even if Class 2 sensors are allowed, the FIDO UAF credentials will be protected by the operating system
        by requiring user authentication.
        However in some cases it may be acceptable for the sake of end-user convenience. Allowing Class 2
        sensors will enable for instance the use of face recognition in some Samsung devices.
